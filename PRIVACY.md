# Game Factory Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** December 18, 2025

## Overview

Game Factory is a ChatGPT Store application that generates and runs text-adventure games. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## What We Collect

### Data We Process During Gameplay
- **Game State**: Your current position in the game, health points, inventory, and progress
- **Game Choices**: The actions you select during gameplay
- **Game Settings**: Genre, tone, difficulty, and length preferences you choose

### What We Do NOT Collect
- Personal identification information
- Email addresses or contact information
- Location data (precise or approximate)
- Device information or identifiers
- Browsing history or chat history
- Payment information
- API keys, passwords, or authentication credentials

## How We Use Data

Game state and choices are processed solely to:
1. Run your game session
2. Generate appropriate story content
3. Track your progress within a single session
4. Generate end-of-run statistics

## Data Retention

- **Session Data**: Automatically deleted after 4 hours of inactivity
- **No Persistent Storage**: We do not maintain any database of user data
- **No Cross-Session Tracking**: Each game session is independent

## Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or transfer any data to third parties.

## Seed Codes

When you share a "challenge seed" with friends:
- The seed contains only game configuration (genre, tone, length)
- No personal data is included in seed codes
- Seed codes do not identify you in any way

## Your Rights

You have the right to:
- Play without creating an account
- End your session at any time (data is immediately discardable)
- Request information about data processing

## Content Safety

All generated content is filtered to ensure:
- No occult, spiritual, or ritualistic themes
